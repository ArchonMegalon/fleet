# LTD Integration Operating Model

Chummer may use lifetime or external tools only through Chummer-owned boundaries.

## Classification

- `use_now`: verified, bounded, replaceable, and backed by first-party receipts
- `pilot`: useful enough to trial behind kill switches and fallback paths
- `park`: potentially useful later, but not relied on for release-critical truth
- `avoid`: not safe, not verified, or not a product fit

## Non-negotiable rules

- no provider name appears in public landing, guide, route, screenshot, or public metadata copy
- no external tool owns rule truth, package truth, campaign truth, support truth, or release truth
- every active adapter has a kill switch, fallback path, receipt surface, and retention posture
- only `use_now` and approved `pilot` adapters may participate in product-critical flows

## Required proof

- inventory freshness
- classification rationale
- stub or live verification where approved
- Chummer-owned receipt and closeout trail
- public-copy neutrality

## Answerly classification

- `support_assistant`: `pilot`
- `rules_humanizer`: `pilot`
- `rules_backend`: `avoid`
- `sourcebook_training_without_license_receipt`: `avoid`
