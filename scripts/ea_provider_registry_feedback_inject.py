    # EA provider registry and Unmixr feedback

    Date: 2026-03-11
    Audience: `executive-assistant` and `solo-ea`
    Status: injected fleet feedback

    The runtime kernel is still the strongest part of EA. The missing bounded context is now a typed provider registry.

    ## Main findings

    * LTD truth still lives in multiple places at once: `LTDs.md`, `SKILLS.md`, env scaffolding, and JSON policy bags.
    * the existing plan/skill/tool runtime is already strong enough; a second integration framework is not needed.
    * provider lifecycle and capability verification should be modeled explicitly instead of buried in free-form metadata.
    * auth still fails open too easily in dev-like configurations.
    * bootstrap/runtime profile can still drift into mixed modes.

    ## Recommended bounded context

    Add typed provider models:

    * `ProviderProfile`
    * `ProviderBinding`
    * `ProviderCapabilityProbe`
    * `SkillProviderBinding`

    Then move providers through:

    * `tracked`
    * `auth_configured`
    * `discovered`
    * `capability_verified`
    * `skill_bound`
    * `operational`

    `LTDs.md` should become a rendered report, not the source of truth.

    ## Runtime direction

    Keep the existing execution path:

    * `skill_key -> task_key -> planner -> tools -> artifact -> dispatch/memory`

    Route by capability, not vendor name.

    ## First operational providers

    * BrowserAct
    * 1min.AI
    * Unmixr
    * ApiX-Drive
    * ApproveThis

    Evidence/content providers:

    * Paperguide
    * Documentation.AI

    Projection/storage surfaces:

    * Teable
    * Internxt

    ## Unmixr-first guidance

    Unmixr is the cleanest next provider because its API is concrete today.

    First provider tools:

    * `unmixr.voice_list`
    * `unmixr.voice_detail`
    * `unmixr.tts_generate`
    * `unmixr.clone_voice`
    * `unmixr.cloned_voice_list`
    * `unmixr.credit_balance`

    `unmixr.tts_generate` should:

    * chunk below the documented request limits
    * persist audio into the existing artifact repository
    * emit receipts with voice, locale, usage, and request metadata
    * support optional secondary secret refs when an extra upstream key is required

    ## Small cleanup

    * add Unmixr env placeholders to local env examples
    * replace stale `EA_LEDGER_BACKEND=memory` overlays with `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory`
    * keep Teable out of the hot-path runtime DB role
