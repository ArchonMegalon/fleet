    # EA provider registry and Unmixr feedback

    Date: 2026-03-11
    Audience: `executive-assistant` and `solo-ea`
    Status: injected fleet feedback

    The runtime kernel is still the strongest part of EA, but the product layer is now clearly ahead of the remaining code boundaries. The missing bounded context is a typed provider registry plus typed catalog metadata.

    ## Main findings

    * the product surface is now materially stronger: LTD inventory, first-class skills, skill-aware plan compile/execute, BrowserAct-backed LTD refresh, workflow templates, and a broad contract-heavy test surface are all real improvements.
    * LTD truth still lives in multiple places at once: `LTDs.md`, `SKILLS.md`, env scaffolding, provider hints, and JSON policy bags.
    * the existing `skill_key -> task_key -> planner -> tools -> artifact -> dispatch/memory` runtime is already strong enough; a second integration framework is not needed.
    * auth still fails open too easily in dev-like configurations when `EA_API_TOKEN` is blank.
    * bootstrap/runtime profile can still drift into mixed durability modes because subsystem fallback is resolved independently instead of from one runtime profile.
    * task/skill metadata is still effectively sourced from free-form `budget_policy_json`.
    * the provider layer is still mostly conceptual; provider hints exist, but runtime execution is still built around hardcoded built-ins and BrowserAct-specific pre-artifact logic.
    * docs and deployment surfaces still lag the runtime: architecture map, env examples, compose overlays, and Dockerfiles are behind the actual router/provider surface.
    * `orchestrator.py` remains too large, and the skill catalog still piggybacks on task-contract storage and read-time synthesis instead of a real projection.

    ## Recommended bounded context

    Add typed provider models:

    * `ProviderProfile`
    * `ProviderBinding`
    * `ProviderCapabilityProbe`
    * `SkillProviderBinding`

    Then move providers through:

    * `tracked`
    * `auth_configured`
    * `discovered`
    * `capability_verified`
    * `skill_bound`
    * `operational`

    `LTDs.md` should become a rendered report, not the source of truth. The real schema should stop leaking through `budget_policy_json`.

    ## Runtime direction

    Keep the existing execution path:

    * `skill_key -> task_key -> planner -> tools -> artifact -> dispatch/memory`

    Route by capability, not vendor name.

    Add typed metadata alongside the provider registry:

    * `WorkflowConfig`
    * `RetryPolicy`
    * `HumanReviewPolicy`
    * `MemoryCandidatePolicy`
    * `ArtifactOutputPolicy`
    * `SkillCatalogMeta`

    ## First operational providers

    * BrowserAct
    * 1min.AI
    * Unmixr
    * ApiX-Drive
    * ApproveThis

    Evidence/content providers:

    * Paperguide
    * Documentation.AI

    Projection/storage surfaces:

    * Teable
    * Internxt

    ## Unmixr-first guidance

    Unmixr is the cleanest next provider because its API is concrete today.

    First provider tools:

    * `unmixr.voice_list`
    * `unmixr.voice_detail`
    * `unmixr.tts_generate`
    * `unmixr.clone_voice`
    * `unmixr.cloned_voice_list`
    * `unmixr.credit_balance`

    `unmixr.tts_generate` should:

    * chunk below the documented request limits
    * persist audio into the existing artifact repository
    * emit receipts with voice, locale, usage, and request metadata
    * support optional secondary secret refs when an extra upstream key is required

    ## Small cleanup

    * add Unmixr env placeholders to local env examples
    * replace stale `EA_LEDGER_BACKEND=memory` overlays with `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory`
    * keep Teable out of the hot-path runtime DB role

    ## Recommended implementation order

    1. add startup validation in `create_app()` and fail fast in prod unless `EA_API_TOKEN`, `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres`, and `DATABASE_URL` are coherent
    2. resolve one `RuntimeProfile` at startup and report that exact profile in readiness instead of letting services fall back independently
    3. parse task/skill metadata into typed models so planner and skill code stop reading raw `budget_policy_json`
    4. build a real provider registry and provider/plugin interface; move BrowserAct behind it first and land Unmixr as the first API-native provider
    5. split orchestration execution from orchestration read models and stop synthesizing skills entirely on read
    6. bring `ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`, compose, env examples, and Dockerfiles back into sync with the runtime surface

    ## Bottom line

    The runtime kernel is good enough to keep. What is missing is a canonical provider layer that turns LTDs/providers from markdown notes and provider hints into executable, capability-addressable provider bindings.
