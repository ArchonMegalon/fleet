## Boundary notes

### `chummer6-core`

The only repo allowed to define canonical mechanics truth.

### `chummer6-ui`

The only repo allowed to define workbench/browser/desktop product UX.

### `chummer6-mobile`

The only repo allowed to define the dedicated live play/mobile shell.

### `chummer6-hub`

The only repo allowed to own hosted orchestration, but not the only repo allowed to own hosted services.
Registry and media must remain separate service boundaries.

### `chummer6-ui-kit`

The only repo allowed to own shared cross-head UI primitives.

### `chummer6-hub-registry`

The only repo allowed to own immutable artifact catalog and publication/install truth.

### `chummer6-media-factory`

The only repo allowed to own render execution and render-asset lifecycle.

### `fleet`

The only adjacent repo allowed to own cross-repo worker scheduling and landing control, but never canonical Chummer product truth.

## Ownership violations

Any of the following is an ownership violation:

* a repo introduces a shared cross-repo DTO family outside its canonical package
* hub reintroduces media rendering or registry persistence after those splits complete
* ui reclaims play-shell ownership
* mobile reimplements rules truth
* ui-kit gains domain DTOs or HTTP clients
* engine begins depending on ui/mobile/hub code
* design repo becomes stale enough that code repos must invent architecture locally
* fleet introduces execution policy that contradicts mirrored design canon
