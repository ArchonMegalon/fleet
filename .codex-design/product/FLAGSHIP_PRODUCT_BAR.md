# Flagship product bar

## Purpose

This file defines what "flagship grade" means for Chummer.

It exists so whole-product quality is not reduced to "the tests passed" or "the milestone registry is empty."
`FLAGSHIP_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.yaml` is the machine-readable proof surface that operationalizes this bar.

## Core rule

A surface is not flagship grade just because it is feature-complete.
It is flagship grade only when the feature is:

* obvious to discover
* fast to use under real table pressure
* trustworthy when it explains itself
* visually and interaction-wise coherent with the rest of Chummer
* honest about limitations, preview posture, and recovery paths
* strong enough that a paying user would feel they received a deliberately crafted product rather than a successful internal tool

## Product-wide flagship promises

### 1. One obvious primary path per major job

Every major user intent must have one clear primary route:

* build a character
* understand a rule outcome
* compare options
* prepare or run a session
* recover from a crash or interrupted install
* publish or share an artifact

Fallback paths may exist.
They must not read like the real product while the primary path still feels provisional.

### 1b. Desktop familiarity must still read as Chummer5a

Desktop flagship quality is not satisfied by feature coverage alone.
The promoted desktop head must still read like Chummer to a veteran user:

* a real desktop menu
* first-class master index and character roster routes
* workbench-first startup instead of decorative landing chrome
* dense builder posture that feels like an instrument rather than a dashboard

For the remaining hard parity families, familiarity is judged by `CHUMMER5A_HUMAN_PARITY_ACCEPTANCE_SPEC.md` and `CHUMMER5A_HUMAN_PARITY_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.yaml`, not by aggregate desktop readiness alone.
If those families do not have direct dialog-level screenshot, runtime, and per-element verdict proof, the desktop head is not yet flagship grade.

Desktop familiarity is necessary but not sufficient.
The harder bar is whether a veteran user can move with the same:

* speed
* confidence
* reversibility
* inspectability
* trust under pressure

### 1c. Install and first-run experience must feel like one product

The promoted desktop path must behave like one coherent Chummer experience:

* guided product installer path first
* installer or in-app claim and recovery handling
* no browser ritual to copy or paste a claim code by hand
* first launch opens the real workbench or restore continuation flow

### 1a. Desktop head authority is explicit

`Chummer.Avalonia` is the default flagship desktop head for the current delivery wave.
No second desktop head is currently part of the public desktop shelf.
If another desktop head is shipped later, it must meet the flagship bar directly instead of borrowing Avalonia proof.

### 2. Explainability and trust stay first-class

Flagship grade requires:

* explain receipts where the user expects "why?"
* bounded `why not?`, `what changed?`, and `what if I toggle this one factor?` answers on promoted explain surfaces
* visible state for conditional modifiers, active effects, and timed changes
* packet-backed source-anchor posture rather than folklore labels, detached citations, or presenter-only narration
* public release truth that matches the shelf, help copy, and install reality

The detailed explain contract lives in `EXPLAIN_EVERY_VALUE_AND_GROUNDED_FOLLOW_UP.md`.

### 2a. Trust, durability, and explainability outrank cosmetic similarity

Flagship grade fails when any of these are weak even if the shell looks familiar:

* update, rollback, restore, or first-launch trust
* character and campaign durability across migration or device change
* custom-data and amend-package survival
* large-sheet and dense-roster performance
* rule explainability where users ask "why?", "why not?", or "what changed?"

Those planes are machine-tracked in `FLAGSHIP_READINESS_PLANES.yaml`.

### 3. SR4, SR5, and SR6 must feel authored, not flattened

Ruleset support is not done when one lowest-common-denominator form can technically enter the data.

Flagship grade requires:

* deterministic parity in engine truth
* ruleset-specific terminology where the editions materially differ
* ruleset-specific interaction affordances where a shared generic workflow would feel confusing or lossy
* import and migration proof that catches silent rules drift

### 4. Dense data must feel comfortable at expert speed

Chummer is a power-user product.
Flagship grade therefore requires:

* grouped inspection instead of long flat walls of state
* fast compare and scan behavior
* cancel-safe editing for high-risk multistep flows
* visible timelines where training, downtime, travel, or temporary effects matter

### 5. Recovery must be boring

Users must be able to survive:

* app crashes
* update failures
* broken downloads
* device changes
* reconnect/replay situations

without losing trust in the product.

Recovery also fails when the product tells different stories in different places.
Installer bytes, release-channel truth, public shelf truth, in-app update truth, and support truth must agree or the release is not flagship grade.

### 6. Imports must respect prior investment

Legacy Chummer and adjacent import lanes are not only migration helpers.
They are also quality oracles.

Flagship grade requires:

* respectful import of legacy user state where the product promises parity
* explicit receipts when an import is partial, lossy, or blocked
* regression and oracle tests that compare imported source facts against Chummer6-derived outcomes

### 7. Rule environments must be explicit and portable

Flagship grade requires:

* the active ruleset, preset, and amend package set are visible where users build, explain, import, restore, and compare
* package activation has preview, diff, dependency, and rollback posture instead of ambient custom-data magic
* missing, incompatible, or downgraded packages are explicit before the product computes against the wrong environment
* the amend-package family is strong enough to support current custom-data needs and later governed promotion without inventing a second representation

### 8. Public surfaces must feel premium and honest

`chummer.run`, downloads, guides, help, and artifact shelves must feel like a deliberate product front door:

* polished enough to create trust
* bounded enough to avoid overclaiming
* aligned enough that install, update, help, and support routes never contradict each other

### 8a. Public proof, preview, fallback, and flagship claims stay distinct

Public trust language must keep four different promises separate:

* proof shelf language can say what was posted, recently checked, and inspectable today
* preview language can invite real use without implying flagship completeness
* fallback language must name backup, recovery, or compatibility posture explicitly and must not read like the recommended route
* flagship language is reserved for surfaces that independently clear `FLAGSHIP_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.yaml`

When those promises appear on the same page, the install shelf remains the authority for what to start with.
Proof cards, artifact explainers, captions, preview siblings, and packet-detail artifacts can support that page, but they must stay visibly secondary to the recommended route.

Artifact-factory cards, preview siblings, captions, explainers, and packet-detail artifacts can make the product more inspectable.
They do not by themselves turn a preview lane or fallback route into a flagship promise, and they do not become substitute route authority for the public install shelf.

### 9. Surface design must be systematized, not improvised

Flagship grade requires a shared cross-surface design contract.

That contract lives in `SURFACE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_AND_AI_REVIEW_LOOP.md` and is mandatory for:

* desktop workbench
* mobile/play shell
* Hub and support surfaces
* public landing, downloads, and guides
* artifact preview and publication surfaces

Flagship grade therefore requires:

* one shared token and state language across heads
* platform-respectful layouts instead of lowest-common-denominator reuse
* dark and light themes that are both trustworthy
* screenshot-based critique and revision before promoted UI changes are accepted

## Repo implications

### `chummer6-core`

* deterministic rules, import, explain, and parity proof must be strong enough that UI polish is not hiding mechanical uncertainty

### `chummer6-ui`

* workbench and desktop surfaces must feel premium under heavy use
* SR4/SR5/SR6 differences must get authored UX where the editions meaningfully diverge

### `chummer6-mobile`

* play-shell continuity, reconnect, and tablet/mobile comfort must feel trustworthy during live play, not just in happy-path demos

### `chummer6-hub` and `chummer6-hub-registry`

* landing, account, downloads, publication, install guidance, and support/control surfaces must feel like one product

### `chummer6-ui-kit`

* shared tokens, dense-data primitives, accessibility, and localization posture must enable flagship-quality work across heads
* shared implementation substrate must make `SURFACE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_AND_AI_REVIEW_LOOP.md` cheap to apply instead of leaving every head to reinvent quality locally

### `chummer6-media-factory`

* artifact outputs, previews, and manifests must feel polished enough to justify publication and recap surfaces as true product lanes

### `fleet` and `executive-assistant`

* the loop must keep decomposing and proving full-product work instead of confusing wave closure with whole-product completion

## Release consequence

Public release is not truly complete until flagship bar evidence exists for:

* desktop build, startup, and support reality
* rules parity and import confidence
* explicit rule-environment and amend-package honesty
* cross-surface design authorship and screenshot-backed quality proof
* mobile play continuity
* public/download/help honesty
* artifact and publication credibility
* operator and support loop trust

Release proof must also classify intentional divergence explicitly:

* `must_match`
* `may_improve`
* `may_remove_if_non_degrading`

That evidence must compile into `FLAGSHIP_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.yaml` rather than remaining only prose or operator intuition.
