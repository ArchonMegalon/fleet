    # EA main-branch hardening audit

    Date: 2026-03-10
    Audience: `executive-assistant` repo owners and the `solo-ea` fleet lane
    Status: injected fleet feedback

    ## Summary

    The current `main` branch is real progress and is worth building on seriously.

    The strongest improvements are now clear:

    * FastAPI app and container boundaries are more explicit.
    * settings are structured instead of ad hoc
    * non-health routers are request-auth protected when configured
    * the runtime image is slimmer
    * operator scripts around Postgres state are materially better
    * CI now covers a broader runtime and storage surface

    The next gains should come from hardening and decomposition, not from stuffing more behavior into the current core files.

    ## What is healthier now

    * `create_app()` builds the container once, mounts health separately, and protects the main routers
    * settings are grouped into core, runtime, storage, auth, policy, and channel sections
    * the runtime is no longer pretending to be only a rewrite service
    * Postgres tooling and operator scripts now explain state and disk usage more honestly
    * the repo root still points toward a durable executive-assistant runtime with queued execution, approvals, routing, tools, delivery, and memory

    ## Priority order

    1. Fix artifact durability and binary safety.
    2. Fix `connector.dispatch` contract enforcement and central tool payload validation.
    3. Add prod auth boot guards and explicit principal strategy.
    4. Make worker topology explicit in compose.
    5. Split `orchestrator.py`.
    6. Split `tool_execution.py`.
    7. Build memory context packs and conflict resolution.
    8. Break up the giant smoke runtime API test.

    ## Primary required work

    ### 1. Artifact durability and storage design

    This is the highest-priority hole.

    Current risk:

    * artifact metadata is durable in Postgres
    * artifact bodies still land on local filesystem storage
    * the default artifacts dir is effectively ephemeral
    * storage refs use `file://` paths
    * body writes are text-first even though artifacts already model `mime_type` and attachments
    * default compose does not mount a dedicated durable artifact volume

    Required direction:

    * add a named `ea-artifacts` volume immediately
    * wire `EA_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to that mount
    * move toward a real artifact backend abstraction
    * make storage handles opaque instead of storing `file://` paths as the durable contract
    * make artifact persistence binary-safe

    ### 2. Tool execution contracts

    Current risk:

    * `connector.dispatch` declares one input contract but executes against a stricter hidden contract
    * `binding_id` is required in execution flow but not required by the declared schema
    * `allowed_channels` is declared but not centrally enforced before dispatch
    * principal scoping rules differ between BrowserAct and connector dispatch paths

    Required direction:

    * require `binding_id` in the declared tool schema
    * add central payload validation in the invocation path
    * enforce `allowed_channels` deterministically before dispatch
    * unify binding resolution and principal scoping rules across built-in tools
    * make contract tests prove schema-versus-executor alignment

    ### 3. Auth and production strictness

    Current risk:

    * request auth becomes a no-op if `EA_API_TOKEN` is unset
    * request context can silently fall back to a default or `"local-user"`
    * prod readiness checks enforce Postgres more strongly than auth

    Required direction:

    * refuse prod startup without `EA_API_TOKEN`
    * log the effective auth and principal strategy at startup
    * allow default-principal fallback only outside prod
    * make principal resolution explicit in prod instead of silently forgiving missing caller identity

    ### 4. Deployment topology

    Current risk:

    * code already supports worker-like roles
    * default compose still presents only API plus DB
    * operational truth therefore lags runtime truth

    Required direction:

    * add `ea-api`, `ea-worker`, and `ea-scheduler` services explicitly
    * share the same durable artifact storage across them
    * stop using the API process as the implicit background execution lane
    * replace fixed idle sleep with bounded backoff or a wake-up mechanism

    ### 5. Service concentration

    The biggest structural risk is now concentrated in a few oversized centers:

    * `orchestrator.py`
    * `tool_execution.py`
    * `memory_runtime.py`
    * `tests/smoke_runtime_api.py`

    Required direction:

    * extract `queue_runtime`, `step_executor`, `approval_runtime`, `human_task_runtime`, and `session_projection` out of the orchestrator
    * split tool execution into adapter-focused modules
    * separate memory CRUD from memory reasoning
    * split the smoke runtime API file by domain scenario instead of keeping a giant pseudo-smoke monolith

    ### 6. Policy maturity

    `PolicyDecisionService` is useful but still too thin for the stated EA vision.

    Required direction:

    * evolve policy toward `PolicyCompiler`, `ActionEvaluator`, `ApprovalEvaluator`, and `EgressEvaluator`
    * model authority, data class, delivery preference, interruption budget, stakeholder sensitivity, and review class explicitly
    * move from text-size and send-like heuristics toward assistant governance

    ### 7. Memory maturity

    The memory substrate is valuable, but the next step is cognition rather than more raw tables.

    Required direction:

    * add `ContextPackBuilder`
    * add `MemoryConflictResolver`
    * add `CommitmentRiskEngine`
    * add `StakeholderModelService`
    * keep Postgres as runtime truth and use external projection surfaces only for approved projections

    ### 8. Naming and doc cleanup

    Current drift:

    * README still front-loads LTD and holding-company inventory above the runtime spine
    * defaults still say `ea-rewrite` in places where the runtime is broader than rewrite flows
    * one overlay still uses deprecated `EA_LEDGER_BACKEND`

    Required direction:

    * make the root README runtime-first
    * move inventory-heavy material deeper into docs
    * rename the default app/image posture to `ea-runtime` or `ea-kernel`
    * use `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND` consistently

    ## Queue intent

    Use this audit to steer the next EA slices in this order:

    1. durable artifact storage and binary-safe artifact persistence
    2. strict `connector.dispatch` schema, binding, principal, and channel enforcement
    3. production auth/startup fail-closed behavior
    4. explicit worker and scheduler topology in compose
    5. orchestrator decomposition
    6. tool execution decomposition
    7. memory context-pack and conflict logic
    8. smoke test breakup and runtime-first documentation cleanup
